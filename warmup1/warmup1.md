Cooking Recipe
==============

[Fresh Spinach Pasta](https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/05/fresh-spinach-pasta/)

Ingredients
-----------

-   5 oz baby spinach leaves
-   2 3/4 to 3 cups all-purpose flour, preferably unbleached
-   1/2 teaspoon sea salt or kosher salt
-   3 large eggs
-   3 large egg yolks
-   Water (only if abloslutely needed)
-   Additional flour for rolling

Kitchen Tools
-------------

-   Rolling Pin
-   Knife

Instructions
------------

1.  Wash spinach but no need to dry.
2.  With water droplets still clinging to the leaves, wilt spinach in a hot skillet until completely soft, about 4 minutes.
3.  Let cool and wring all the water out of the spinach in small fistfuls.
4.  Then pressing these little bundles out against a fine-mesh strainer.
5.  Rest spinach on papper towels to remove even more water.
6.  Then mince spinach on a cutting board.
7.  Dump spinach, smaller amount of flour and salt on countertop and mix with your fingers.
8.  Then form into a pile.
9.  Make a deep well in the center and add the whole eggs and yolks to it.
10. Use your fingertips to break up the eggs and begin moving your fingers in a circular motion, keeping the eggs within the well. Each circular movement pulls in a little bit of flour from the sides.
11. In a few minutes, the mixture will become thicker and thicker, finally becoming too tight to move easily with your fingers. At this poiont, you can use a bench scraper or spatula to start adding the remaining, a little pile at a time.
12. Once a shaggy dough has formed, begin kneading the mixture, scraping it up when it sticks, until a ball is formed. It will look flaky but will hold together.
13. Knead the dough, pressing it away with the heels of your hands then forming it back into a blob, for 1 to 2 minutes, until the dough is moist but not sticky.
14. Add remaining flour, a spoonful at a time, only if dough is too sticky.
15. Add a drop of two of water only if it's cracking when you knead it.
16. Let it rest for 5 minutes, then knead it again for 5 to 8 minutes.
17. Wrap dough in plastic and let rest at room temperature for and hour.
18. Divide dough into sixths.
19. On a floured surface, roll the pasta asa thin as you can; as thin as a credit card and translucent is ideal.
20. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling, well-salted water for anywhere from 2 to 6 minutes (depending on thickness), until al dente.
21. Drain and toss with fixings of your choice - garlic-sizzled olive oil or melted butter, parmesan or pecorino, dollops of rocotta or mascarpone.
22. Eat immediately.

### Fresh Season of the Year

**This meal can be made year round.**

### Variations

There is one variation of this dish that can be made from Semolina flour.
Also different levels of spinach can be added to make several levels of flavor.

Euclidean Distance
==================

### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\\bar{\\mathbf{pq}})$.

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** =(*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** =(*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:**<sup>\[1\]</sup>
$$d(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}) = d(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + \\dots + (q\_n - p\_n)^2}$$
$$= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i - p\_i)^2}.$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:**<sup>\[1\]</sup>

$$\\|\\mathbf{p}\\| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\dots + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}},$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
